Q1 Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages.


# Some of the common and important concepts in detail:

   ## Markup languages use tags to manipulate / alter data
    An example of this would be Markdown using an "em" tag to emphasise a word.

    This varies somewhat between languages as to the extent of how and how far.

    Manipulation of data to create a structured document is another example which can be seen in various markup languages such as the use of elements in HTML where through a start tag, content tag, and an end tag a simple text is converted into a particular format or has a particular use like the "head" element which contains metadata, and other information which will affect the overall document.

## Markup languages are similair to a verbal/written language
    As with a language like English, markup languages have a few "grammatical" laws known as syntax. Similair to how we learn to read and write appropriate English following the conventions of sentence structuring, spelling, and word building. So too do we learn to read and write appropriate syntax for markup languages by following the convention of tag usage, symantics, and element use.

## They are used to structure data
    To summarise and emphasise this point a little, an example is Markdown using tags and whitespace to create a particular structure.

## They have their unique Schemas
    Again using common written and spoken languages such as English and Chinese it can quickly been shown that not only are the characters of their alphabets completely different, but also their word building, sentence structures and many other aspects are completely unique to that language. Each of these languages has a dictionary unique to themselves that summarises all the appropriate laws such as correct and incorrect spelling. 

    This concept applies directly to markup languages, through the use of their dictionaries, which are known as Schemas
